title: "Model-based Multiple Object Tracking Using  Capacitive Proximity Sensors"
excerpt: "From Oct. 2018 to March. 2019, I was with [M.Sc. Hosam Alagi](http://www.ipr.kit.edu/mitarbeiter_2150.php) and [Prof. Dr.-Ing Bjoern Hein](http://www.ipr.kit.edu/mitarbeiter_2150.php) to develop an object tracking method on capacitive proximity sensor.<br/><img src='/images/project/ipr_profile.png'>"

## Abstract
In this work, an object tracking method on capacitive proximity sensor is presented. Arranged as a vector and installed in the sidewalls of a work table with a robot, these sensors are able to detect proximity events in the near field of the workspace, including human approaching the table or interacting with the robot. Considering the low spatial resolution of the sensors, a preprocessing method was implemented and the data for tracking was prepared. The tracking method is based on a Kalman-Filter, where the data association and occlusion problem are discussed.
