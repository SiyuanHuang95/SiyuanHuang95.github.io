excerpt: "In this work, an object tracking method on capac-itive  proximity sensor is presented. Arranged as a vector and installed  in the sidewalls of a work table with a robot, the sesensors are able to detect proximity events in  the near field of the workspace, including human approaching the table or interacting with the robot."

 In this work, an object tracking method on capac-itive proximity  sensor is presented. Arranged  as  a vector and installed  in  the  sidewalls of a work table with a  robot, these sensors are able  to  detect proximity events in the  near field of the workspace,  including human approaching  the  table or interacting with the  robot. Considering the low spatial resolution of the sensors, a preprocessing method was implementedand the data for tracking was prepared. The tracking method is based on a Kalman-Filter, where the data association and occlusion problem are discussed.
