I am Siyuan Huang, a young researcher at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), with focus on Scenario Mining and SLAM algorithms. Before that, I was a algorithms researcher at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en) and responsible for the multi-sensor fusion based lane detection. I also spent my internship at [HESAI](https://www.hesaitech.com/en) and Daimler China.

I got my master degree with major Mechatronics and Information Technology at [Karlsruher Institute of Technology](www.kit.edu), Germany. And I have worked with [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Gert F. Trommer](https://www.ite.kit.edu/mitarbeiter_gert_trommer.php) and [M.Sc. Christopher Doer](https://www.ite.kit.edu/mitarbeiter_christopher_doer.php) to develop a Thermal-Inertial Odometry framework to enable stable and robust motion estimation in the visually-degraded environment, like dark evening.
