I am Siyuan Huang, a master student with major Mechatronics and Information Technology at Karlsruher Institute of Technology, Germany. Currently, I am working with Prof. Dr.-Ing. Gert F. Trommer and M.Sc. Christopher Doer to develop a Thermal-Inertial Odometry framework to enable stable and robust motion estimation in the visually-degraded environment.
